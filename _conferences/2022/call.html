    <h2>Call for proposals</h2>

    <p>We are pleased to announce our call for papers, posters, panels, and workshops for the Music Encoding Conference 2022. </p>

    <p>As an important cross-disciplinary venue for all who are interested in the digital representation of music, the Music Encoding Conference is open to and brings together members from various encoding, analysis, and music research communities, including musicologists, theorists, librarians, technologists, music scholars, teachers, and students, and provides an opportunity for learning and engaging with and from each other.</p>

    <p>The MEC 2022 will take place Thursday 19th – Sunday 22nd May, 2022, at Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia, Canada. While we sincerely hope to welcome as many attendees in person as possible, this year’s Conference will again run in hybrid mode, allowing remote attendance where travel plans are affected by the ongoing pandemic.</p>

    <h4>Background</h4>

    <p>Music encoding is a critical component for fields and areas of study including computational or digital musicology, digital editions, symbolic music information retrieval, digital libraries, digital pedagogy, or the wider music industry. </p>

    <p>The Music Encoding Conference has emerged as the foremost international forum where researchers and practitioners from across these varied fields can meet and explore new developments in music encoding and its use. The Conference celebrates a multidisciplinary program, combining the latest advances from established music encodings, novel technical proposals and encoding extensions, and the presentation or evaluation of new practical applications of music encoding (e.g. in academic study, libraries, editions, pedagogy, commercial products).</p>

    <p>Pre-conference workshops provide an opportunity to quickly engage with best practice in the community. Newcomers are encouraged to submit to the main program with articulations of the potential for music encoding in their work, highlighting strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches within this context.</p>

    <p>Following the formal program, an unconference session fosters collaboration in the community through the meeting of Interest Groups, and self-selected discussions on hot topics that emerge during the conference. For these meetings, there are various spaces generously provided by the hosting institution on May 22nd. Please be in touch with conference organizers if you need to reserve these spaces. For meetings on other days during or immediately after the conference, availability can be checked upon request.</p>

    <p>The program welcomes contributions from all those working on, or with, any music encoding. In addition, the Conference serves as a focus event for the Music Encoding Initiative community, with its annual community meeting scheduled the day following the main program. We in particular seek to broaden the scope of musical repertories considered, and to provide a welcoming, inclusive community for all who are interested in this work.</p>


    <h4>Topics</h4>

    <p>The conference welcomes contributions from all those who are developing or applying music encodings in their work and research. Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>data structures for music encoding</li>
        <li>music encoding standardisation</li>
        <li>music encoding interoperability / universality</li>
        <li>methodologies for encoding, music editing, description and analysis</li>
        <li>computational analysis of encoded music</li>
        <li>rendering of symbolic music data in audio and graphical forms</li>
        <li>conceptual encoding of relationships between multimodal music forms (e.g. symbolic music data, encoded text, facsimile images, audio)</li>
        <li>capture, interchange, and re-purposing of musical data and metadata</li>
        <li>ontologies, authority files, and linked data in music encoding and description</li>
        <li>(symbolic) music information retrieval using music encoding</li>
        <li>evaluation of music encodings</li>
        <li>best practice in approaches to music encoding</li>
    </ul>

    <p>and the use or application of music encodings in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>music theory and analysis</li>
        <li>digital musicology and, more broadly, digital humanities</li>
        <li>digital editions</li>
        <li>music digital libraries</li>
        <li>bibliographies and bibliographic studies</li>
        <li>catalogues and collection management</li>
        <li>composition</li>
        <li>performance</li>
        <li>teaching and learning</li>
        <li>search and browsing</li>
        <li>multimedia music presentation, exploration, and exhibition</li>
        <li>machine learning approaches.</li>
    </ul>


    <h4 id="submissions">Submissions</h4>
    <p> In response to feedback received from the community on last year’s submission process, this year’s MEC will be accepting paper and poster submissions in the following forms (<em>page counts include figures and tables, but exclude references</em>): </p>
    <p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Full paper submissions</strong> of up to 8 pages,</li>
  <li><strong>Short paper submissions</strong> of up to 4 pages,</li>
  <li><strong>Poster submissions</strong> of up to 2 pages.</li>
</ul></p>

  <p> In addition, MEC ‘22 welcomes submissions of proposals for <strong>panel sessions</strong> and <strong>workshops</strong>. Submissions to each category will be reviewed according to specific expectations outlined in <a href="#submission">Submission Guidelines</a> below.  </p>

  <p> Authors of full and short paper submissions will have the option of choosing between two <strong>presentation formats</strong>: “standard” (the default for <em>both</em> submission types) and “extended”, corresponding to the length of the offered presentation slot if the submission is accepted. Authors of full papers requesting extended presentations will be guaranteed their choice. We will aim to accommodate authors of short papers in their preference where possible.  </p>

  <p> Authors of poster submissions will be given the opportunity to briefly present their work in plenary setting (“lightning talk”) in addition to a poster session if accepted.  </p>

  <p> All submissions will be reviewed by multiple members of the program committee before acceptance.  </p>
  
  <p> Please note the deadlines for the submission process outlined under <a href="#dates">Important Dates</a> below. </p>
  

  <h4 id="submission">Submission Guidelines</h4>
  <p>
  All submissions should be formatted in A4 size with 2.5cm margins, font size 12, single space, justified, in a sans-serif typeface (e.g. Calibri) according to <a href="https://tinyurl.com/mec2022-submission-template">the MEC 2022 Submission Template</a> (please take care to remove all identifying information from the submitted PDF before the upload.)

<p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Panel discussions (3–5 pages; submissions should describe the topic and nature of the discussion, along with the main theses and objectives of the proposed contributions, as well as short biographies of the participants; panel discussions are not expected to be a set of papers which could otherwise be submitted as individual papers).

  <h4>
    Additional information
  </h4>

  <p>
  While we look forward to welcoming as many of you as possible in person at Dalhousie University, we are preparing for MEC ‘22 within the context of ongoing uncertainty due to the Covid-19 pandemic. To allow the community to best accommodate to this situation, we are organising this year’s conference with the following commitments in mind: 
  </p>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The conference will allow remote participation as in the previous years (MEC ‘20 and ‘21). Decisions on the precise implementation of this year’s hybrid format will be announced in due course and communicated widely (conference web page, mailing list, MEI Slack, Twitter) in the months leading up to the event.
    </li>
    <li>
      We commit to the announced dates for MEC ‘22 (19th-22nd May). There will be no rescheduling of the conference to fit projected changes in the pandemic situation this year.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  Additional details regarding registration, accommodation, etc. will be announced on the <a href="https://music-encoding.org/conference/2022/">conference web page</a>.
